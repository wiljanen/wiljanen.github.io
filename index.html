<h2>Fun Proofs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Classification of Ind-Cyclic Groups:</strong> Let <em>A</em> be a group such that every finitely generated subgroup is cyclic. Then, <em>A</em> is a subquotient of the additive group of the rational numbers.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof:</em> We first remark that <em>A</em> is abelian since any two elements are contained inside a cyclic subgroup. We break into two cases:
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong><em>A</em> is torsion-free.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>B</em> be the &#x211A; vector space formed by forming the module of fractions of <em>A</em> with respect to the multiplicative set consisting of all non-zero integers. Using that any two elements of <em>A</em> generate a cyclic subgroup, we find that <em>B</em> is one-dimensional unless <em>A</em> is trivial. Assuming <em>A</em> is non-trivial, then <em>B</em> is isomorphic to the additive group of the rational numbers, so the natural inclusion of <em>A</em> into <em>B</em> embeds <em>A</em> as a subgroup of the additive group of the rational numbers.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong><em>A</em> is not torsion-free.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>S</em> be the set of positive integers <em>n</em> such that there exists a non-zero element <em>x</em> of <em>A</em> such that <em>nx = 0</em>. Since <em>A</em> is not torsion-free, we have that <em>S</em> is non-empty.</p>
		<p>Let <em>na = 0</em> for some non-zero element <em>a</em> in <em>A</em> and some <em>n</em> in <em>S</em>, and let <em>b</em> in <em>A</em>. The subgroup generated by <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is cyclic, so there exists <em>c</em> in <em>A</em> and integers <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> such that <em>a = sc</em> and <em>b = tc</em>. Then, we have that <em>(ns)b = (nst)c = t(na) = 0</em>. Therefore, <em>A</em> is a torsion group.</p>
		<p>For <em>n</em> in <em>S</em>, let <em>A[n]</em> be the set of <em>x</em> in <em>A</em> such that <em>nx = 0</em>. Observe that <em>A[n]</em> is a torsion abelian group of cardinality at most <em>n</em> since if <em>a<sub>0</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></em> are elements of <em>A[n]</em>, then they generate a cyclic group of exponent <em>n</em> and so there must have been repetitions. In particular, <em>A[n]</em> is a finite cyclic group. Let <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> be the <em>finite</em> set of embeddings from <em>A[n]</em> into the quotient of the rationals by the integers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#x211A;/&#x2124;</span>.</p>
		<p>If <em>n</em> divides <em>m</em>, then an element of <em>X<sub>m</sub></em> yields an element of <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> by restriction of functions. Hence, the <em>X<sub>n</sub></em> form a projective system. Since the projective limit of non-empty finite sets is non-empty, we find that there is an embedding of <em>A</em> into the quotient of the rationals by the integers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#x211A;/&#x2124;</span>.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(Some people call these locally cyclic groups.)</p>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Let <em>A</em> be a commutative ring such that every prime ideal is principal. Then, every ideal of <em>A</em> is principal.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof:</em> Let <em>S</em> be set of non-principal ideals of <em>A</em>. If <em>S</em> is empty, then every ideal is principal. So, assume <em>S</em> is non-empty.
	<p>Let <em>{I<sub>&alpha;</sub>}</em> be a chain in <em>S</em>. Let <em>I</em> be the union of the ideals <em>I<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>. Then, <em>I</em> is an ideal of <em>A</em>. If <em>I</em> was principal, then its generator would be in one of the <em>I<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>, which would force that <em>I = I<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>. Hence, <em>I</em> is not principal, and so <em>I</em> is in <em>S</em>. By Zorn's lemma, <em>S</em> contains a maximal element <em>M</em>. Since <em>M</em> is not principal, it is not a prime ideal by assumption. Thus, there exists elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> not in <em>M</em> such that the product <em>ab</em> is in <em>M</em>.</p>
	<p>Let <em>N</em> be the set of elements <em>x</em> of <em>A</em> such that <em>ax</em> is an element of <em>M</em>. Then, <em>N</em> is an ideal containing <em>M</eM> and containing <em>b</em>. By the maximality of <em>M</em>, we find that <em>N = (n)</em> is principal. Similarly, the ideal <em>K</em> generated by <em>M</em> and <em>a</em> is principal, so <em>K = (k)</em>. We have that <em>KN</em> is contained in <em>M</eM>.</p>
	<p>Let <em>x</em> be an element of <em>M</em>. Then, <em>x</em> is in <em>K</em>, so <em style="white-space: nowrap;">x = kt</em>. Then, <em>t</em> is in <em>N</em> since <em>a</em> is a multiple of <em>k</em>. Therefore, <em style="white-space: nowrap;">t = ns</em>, and <em style="white-space: nowrap;">x = kns</em> is in <em>KN</em>. Thus, <em>M = KN</em>, and <em>M</em> is principal.</p>
	<p>(For similar results and proofs, see Kaplansky's Commutative Rings Revised Edition. The above proof is outlined in Exercise 10 of Section 1-1 and is attributed to M. Isaacs.)
	</div>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>Kaplansky's Criterion:</strong> Let <em>A</em> be an integral domain, then <em>A</em> is a <abbr title="Unique Factorization Domain">UFD</abbr> if and only if every non-zero prime ideal contains a prime element. If <em>A</em> is Noetherian, this is equivalent to every height 1 prime being principal.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof:</em>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong>Suppose <em>A</em> is a UFD.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>P</em> be a non-zero prime of <em>A</em>. Then, <em>P</em> is non-zero, so it contains some non-zero element <em>a</em>. Since <em>A</em> is a UFD, we find that <em style="white-space: nowrap;">x = &pi;<sub>1</sub>&middot;&middot;&middot;&pi;<sub>n</sub></em> for some prime elements <em>&pi;<sub>i</sub></em>. Since <em>P</em> is prime, we find that <em>&pi;<sub>j</sub></em> is in <em>P</em> for some <em>j</em>. Hence, <em>P</em> contains a prime element.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Suppose that every non-zero prime ideal contains a prime element.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>S</em> be the set of elements of <em>A</em> which are either invertible or a product of prime elements. Then, <em>S</em> is a multiplicative set not containing 0. So, by Zorn's lemma (on the set of ideals which intersect <em>S</em> trivially), there is a prime ideal <em>P</em> which intersects <em>S</em> trivially. If <em>P</em> is non-zero, then <em>P</em> contains a prime element, which is in <em>S</em>. Since <em>P</em> intersects <em>S</em> trivially, we have that <em>P = (0)</em>. Hence, every non-zero element is either invertible or a product of prime elements. The verification that the existence of prime factorization implies uniqueness of prime factorization is routine, and not very fun, so we omit it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Assume <em>A</em> is Noetherian.</strong>
		<p>Since <em>A</em> is Noetherian, we have Krull's principal ideal theorem which states: the height of a minimal prime over a principal proper ideal is at most 1. Thus, given a non-zero prime <em>P</em> and a non-zero element <em>x</em> of <em>P</em>, we can choose a minimal prime over <em>(x)</em> contained in <em>P</em> (which we can ensure by localizing at <em>P</em>) to show that there is a height 1 prime contained in <em>P</em>. Hence, if every height 1 prime ideal is principal, then every non-zero prime ideal contains a prime element, namely the generator of a height 1 prime ideal contained in the given prime ideal. Conversely, if a height 1 prime ideal <em>P</em> contains a prime element, then <em>P</em> is principal generated by the prime element.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(The first part is Theorem 5 of Section 1-1 of Kaplansky's Commutative Rings Revised Edition. For a reference on the dimension theory of Noetherian rings see for example either Atiyah-MacDonald Corollary 11.12 or Eisenbud Theorem 10.1. The Stacks Project <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(Tag 0AFT)</span> has a different proof of the Noetherian part using the criterion that being a UFD is equivalent to satisfying the <abbr title="Ascending Chain Condition on Principal Ideals">ACCP</abbr> and satisfying that every irreducible element is prime.)</p>

	<li>
	<p>Let <em>k</em> be a field, let <em style="white-space: nowrap;">&rho; : G &rarr; GL<sub>n</sub>(k)</em> be a representation of a group <em>G</em>, and let <em style="white-space: nowrap;">r : k[G] &rarr; End(k<sup>n</sup>)</em> be the associated map defined on the group ring. If <em>r</em> is surjective, then <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible. If <em>k</em> is algebraically closed and <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible, then <em>r</em> is surjective.</p>
	<div>
	<em>Proof:</em>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong>Suppose <em>r</em> is surjective.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>V</em> be a nontrivial invariant subspace of <em>k<sup>n</sup></em>. Let <em>v</em> be a non-zero element of <em>V</em>. Then, for any <em>w</em> in <em>V</em>, there is an endomorphism of <em>k<sup>n</sup></em> sending <em>v</em> to <em>w</em>. Since <em>r</em> is surjective, there is an element <em>a</em> in <em>k[G]</em> which maps to this endomorphism. Then, since <em>V</em> is an invariant subspace, we have that <em>a.v = w</em> is in <em>V</em>. Hence, <em>V = k<sup>n</sup></em>, and <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Suppose that <em>k</em> is algebraically closed and that <em>&rho;</em> is irreducible.</strong>
		<p>Let <em>A</em> be the image of <em>r</em>. Then, <em>k<sup>n</sup></em> is an irreducible <em>A</em>-module. Let <em>f</em> be an element of <em>End<sub>A</sub>(k<sup>n</sup>)</em>. By Schur's lemma, there exists <em>&lambda;</em> in <em>k</em> such that <em>f(v) = &lambda;v</em> for all <em>v</em>. Hence, the natural map <em style="white-space: nowrap;">k &rarr; End<sub>A</sub>(k<sup>n</sup>)</em> is an isomorphism. By the Jacobson density theorem, we find that the natural map <em style="white-space: nowrap;">A &rarr; End<sub>k</sub>(k<sup>n</sup>)</em> is surjective as desired.</p> <p>(For a reference for the Jacobson density theorem, see Lang's Algebra, Chapter XVII, Theorem 3.2.)</p>

<h3>Commutativity Relations</h3>
<p>The goal is to classify which relations of the form <em style="white-space: nowrap;">ab = bwa</em>, where <em>w</em> is a word in <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, imply commutativity for semigroups. If such a relation implies commutativity, then we call it a commutativity relation.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let <em>S</em> be a semigroup such that <em>ab = baba</em> for all <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in <em>S</em>. Then, <em>S</em> is commutative.</p>
<p>
<em>Proof:</em> Let <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> be elements of <em>S</em>. Then,
<pre>
ab = baba
   = (abab)(abab)
   = (ab)(ab)(ab)(ab)
   = abab
   = ba.
</pre>
Therefore, <em>S</em> is commutative.
</p>
</div>
<p>I do not know of any example of noncommutative semigroups where a relation of the form <em>ab = bwa</em> is satisfied.</p>
<p>
<strong>Some Known Commutativity Relations:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><em>ab = (ba)<sup>n</sup></em> for each positive integer <em>n</em></li>
	<li><em>ab = b<sup>n</sup>a<sup>m</sup></em> for each pair of positive integers <em>(n,m)</em></li>
	<li><em>ab = ba<sup>3</sup>ba<sup>3</sup></em>

<h3>Delayed Multiplying Matrices</h3>
<p>The goal is to try to compute the characteristic polynomial of certain matrices which exhibit nice factorization properties for their characteristic polynomials.</p>
<img src="images/doubling03.svg" alt="6 by 6 matrix with 9 ones and the rest of the entries 0, on the top right 3 by 3 identity matrix, on the left hand side there is a 3 by 3 identity matrix with each row is repeated twice in a row" title="Third Delayed Doubling Matrix">
<p>The above matrix is the third delayed doubling matrix. It is constructed by taking the three by three identity matrix, repeating each row twice, and then putting the doubled identity matrix on the left side of a six by six matrix, putting the three by three identity matrix on the top right, and putting zeros on the bottom right.</p>
<p>For a positive integer <em>n</em>, we can construct a <em style="white-space: nowrap;">2n by 2n</em> matrix in a completely analogous way. We denote that matrix <em style="white-space: nowrap;">M<sub>n</sub></em>. We write <em>p<sub>n</sub></em> for the characteristic polynomial of <em style="white-space: nowrap;">M<sub>n</sub></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <em>n</em> be a power of 2, and let <em>m</em> be a positive integer. Then, each entry of the matrix <em>(M<sub>n</sub>)<sup>m</sup></em> is a Fibonacci number.</p> 
<p>After computing a few of the characteristic polynomials, one finds that they seem to all factor in a very nice way.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> For each positive integer <em>n</em>, there exists a non-negative integer <em>t</em>, and non-negative integers <em style="white-space: nowrap;">n<sub>0</sub>, n<sub>1</sub>, ..., n<sub>t</sub></em> such that <em style="white-space: nowrap;">p<sub>n</sub>(x) = x<sup>n<sub>0</sub></sup>(x<sup>2</sup> - x - 1)(x<sup>n<sub>1</sub></sup> - 1)&middot;&middot;&middot;(x<sup>n<sub>t</sub></sup> - 1)</em>.</p>
<p>After further computations, one is seemingly led to a formula for <em>t</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> For <em>n = 2<sup>r</sup>m</em> with <em>m</em> odd, we have <em style="white-space: nowrap;">1+t = &sum;<sub>d|m</sub> <strong>|</strong> (&#x2124;/d&#x2124;)<sup>&times;</sup>/&LeftAngleBracket; 2 &RightAngleBracket; <strong>|</strong></em>.</p>
<p>For a positive integer <em>N</em>, we write <em style="white-space: nowrap;">[N] = {0,1,...,N-1}</em>. For a positive integer <em>n</em>, the delayed doubling map <em style="white-space: nowrap;">T<sub>n</sub> : [2n] &rarr; [2n]</em> is the map defined by <em style="white-space: nowrap;">T<sub>n</sub>(m) = 2m</em> if <em>m</em> is in <em>[n]</em> and by <em style="white-space: nowrap;">T<sub>n</sub>(m) = m - n</em> if <em>m</em> is in <em style="white-space: nowrap;">[2n] \ [n]</em>.
<p>Using the maps <em>T<sub>n</sub></em> we also have a way to seemingly predict the exponents <em style="white-space: nowrap;">n<sub>1</sub>, ..., n<sub>t</sub></em>. We show case this when <em>n = 15</em> below. Note that <em style="white-space: nowrap;">p<sub>15</sub>(x) = x<sup>7</sup>(x<sup>2</sup> - x - 1)(x<sup>7</sup> - 1)(x<sup>6</sup> - 1)(x<sup>5</sup> - 1)(x<sup>3</sup> - 1)</em>.</p>
<img src="images/orbits15.svg" alt="1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 1, 3 to 6 to 12 to 24 to 9 to 18 to 3, 5 to 10 to 20 to 5, 7 to 14 to 28 to 13 to 26 to 11 to 22 to 7, (15 to 0 to 0)" title="Orbits under T&#8345; for n = 15">
<p>In the example, we see that the non-degenerate orbit lengths coincide with the exponents in the <em>x<sup>n<sub>i</sub></sup> - 1</em factors of the characteristic polynomial.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> The exponents <em>n<sub>1</sub>, ..., n<sub>t</sub></em> are exactly the orbit lengths of the non-degenerate orbits of the map <em>T<sub>n</sub></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients for a Potential Proof:</strong> The Coefficient Theorem for Digraphs allows you to relate the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial in terms of linear subdigraphs. This should allow us to connect the orbits of <em>T<sub>n</sub></em> to the characteristic polynomial of <em>M<sub>n</sub></em>. I haven't attempted to formalize this outline due to other projects; please let me know if you carry out such a proof.</p>
<p>(For a reference for the Coefficient Theorem for Diagraphs, one can see Cvetković, Doob, and Sachs's book Spectra of Graphs, or Peña and Rada's paper Energy of digraphs (2008).)
